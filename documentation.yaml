      Reports the number of times that *procedure-name* was called. If
      *procedure-name* is not defined, then reports 0.

        type: string
    description: |
      Reports the exclusive time, in milliseconds, that
      *procedure-name* was running for. Exclusive time is the time
      from when the procedure was entered, until it finishes, but does not
      include any time spent in other user-defined procedures which it
      calls.

      If *procedure-name* is not defined, then reports 0.

      Reports the inclusive time, in milliseconds, that
      *procedure-name* was running for. Inclusive time is the time
      from when the procedure was entered, until it finishes.

      If *procedure-name* is not defined, then reports 0.

    description: |
      Reports a string containing a breakdown of all user-defined procedure
      calls. The `Calls` column contains the number of times a
      user-defined procedure was called. The `Incl T(ms)` column
      is the total time, in milliseconds, it took for the call to complete,
      including the time spent in other user-defined procedures. The
      `Excl T(ms)` column is the total time, in milliseconds,
      spent within that user-defined procedure, not counting other
      user-define procedures it called. The <code>Excl/calls</code> column
      is an estimate of the time, in milliseconds, spent in that
      user-defined procedure for each call.

      Here is example output:

  - name: data

    description: |
      Reports a list of lists containing the results of the profiler in a format that is suitable
      for exporting with the [`csv` extension](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/csv.html).

      The first sublist contains the name of the data columns: `procedure`, `calls`, `inclusive_time` and
      `exclusive_time`. This is followed by one sublist containing the profiler data for each user-defined
      procedure. The reported times are in milliseconds.
