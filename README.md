# NetLogo profiler extension

This package contains the NetLogo profiler extension.

## Using

The profiler extension is pre-installed in NetLogo. For instructions on using it in your model, or for more information about NetLogo extensions, see the NetLogo User Manual.

## Building

Use the NETLOGO environment variable to tell the Makefile which NetLogo.jar to compile against.  For example:

    NETLOGO=/Applications/NetLogo\\\ 5.0beta2 make

If compilation succeeds, `profiler.jar` will be created.
